            <h4 class="subheader">The warning signs</h4>
            <p>
              Sadly there are many single people still falling prey to on line dating site scammers.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to cyber-security expert Chris Parker, there was a 20% increase in bank transfer fraud payments in 2020 alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scammers set up dating site profiles, with one intention, that being to extort money out of vulnerable people looking for love. Their profiles are often very convincing, but Chris Parker has advised on the rRed flags to watch out for. These being:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">The apparent career which sees them traveling with their work</h4>
            <p>
              Scammers will target people who don't live anywhere near the people they approach on dating sites, often they are located overseas, supposedly because of a career which sees them traveling with their work. The favorite profession from our research at Love Problem Solver, appears to be in engineering jobs, military careers which see them playing the hero who is posted in a war torn country in somewhere like the Middle East. This means that they are conveniently too far away from you to meet you in person. They are certainly not the person they claim to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, not all dating site members who live overseas and work in engineering or the military are scammers, so you have to look for other signs and they are:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Copious compliments and flattery</h4>
            <p>
              Scammers usually indulge you in copious flattering compliments. They also waste no time in declaring their love for you and this is a practice that sees so many people falling quickly into a trap which will cost them dearly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flattery is the name of the game with a dating scammer. But it isn't long before the flattery can make the more cautious stop to ponder on the integrity of their new found love interest! Your natural and inherent intuition can be your saviour if you listen to it!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">The Scammer suddenly needs money</h4>
            <p>
              A dating scammer is usually after money, they are experts in extortion and they will sound you out wit their 'foot-in-the-door' approach, this means asking you for a small sum of money, claiming that they need to visit a relative who has suddenly fallen ill or they were burgled recently and have no money to buy food. Payday is always conveniently a few weeks away and they often tell you that they have no savings as they have been sending money to poor members of their family to help them out. Once they have succeeded in extorting a small amount of money from you, they soon progress to extorting larger amounts from you, often for the cost of a plane ticket to come over and sweep you off your feet, they can't wait until payday to do this. How convincing they sound too - don't fall for it! This is about inducing sympathy to create an emotional bond with you but with one purpose only - to extort money from you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">The Scammers profile photo often depicts an incredibly attractive person</h4>
            <p>
              Scammers know that by using photos of very attractive people, that you will soon feel flattered that this beautiful looking person is interested in dating you. The flattery touch is here again!
            </p>
            <p>
              The photos used are too good to be true, flawless complexions, no skin marks like moles or blemishes. The photos are usually professionally lit, and very well posed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often such photos are taken from collections of model images found on search engines and modeling portfolios posted on line. In no way do they depict the person behind the profile as with the information posted on their profiles.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Scammers usually have no digital footprint on line</h4>
            <p>
              Most people in today's digital world will have a digital footprint on line, a social media profile, university and college alma matter class photos, business or professional work profiles on websites such a Linked-in, comments they have posted on various websites about articles published or events that have taken place, etc. They will appear on the electoral roll and listed on directory sites as living at the address they claim to be living at.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are instances where people do not have a digital footprint of course. But such people are usually people whom are not interested in social media, don't possess a computer or can't use on, are perhaps elderly and not Internet savvy, so these people would not have a dating profile on line anyway! Scammers could even claim that their relative created their on line dating profile for them as could a genuine person who isn't Internet savvy and in possession of a personal computer. So some research and see if this new love interest can be found elsewhere on line.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Scammers have a lot in common with you</h4>
            <p>
              The more professional scammer will join a dating website and spend considerable time searching for a good target to extort money out of. The favorite target is a windowed person who might have been left with a good legacy from a late partner. Perhaps one who owns their own home, or has a high paying career.
            </p>
            <p>
              Photos of you enjoying luxury holidays in nice locations, well dressed, wearing nice expensive jewelry and with a nice home or opulent backdrop behind you in your photos showing that you are a person of means and as such an ideal target for a scammer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the scammer has come across a good target on the dating site, they will note the interests you have and what you claim to be searching for in a partner and then they will add the same interests to their profile and then message you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Who wouldn't be interested in someone who seems to have a lot in common with you? Please consider this if you have a dating profile and are on line looking for love.
            </p>

              In the digital world we now live in, it is becoming more and more commonplace to engage in video chatting on line, usually via messenger app's such as "Whatsapp" or "FaceTime", genuine people will want to enjoy video chat and to see the person live on line. But scammers refuse for obvious reasons - they are not the beautiful person depicted by their dating profile, so they find any excuse not to indulge in video chatting. This is why many will claim to be in a military career and posted in a war torn area where they are apparently not allowed to video chat for security reasons! This is one of the biggest Red flags to expose a scammer. Web-cams are inexpensive to buy nowadays, so why wouldn't someone with a computer or a smart phone be unable to video chat with you?

              In addition to the above signs of a scammer we at Love Problem Solver know of other Red Flags:

          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Widowed with no children or family nearby</h4>
            <p>
              Many scammers on dating sites claim to be widowed. They look for sympathy in saying that they lost their long term love partner to a terminal illness such as Cancer and nursed them to the end of their life. They will go on to claim that they either have no children or that they live in a different country or a considerable distance away from their children if they claim to have any. They also tell you that they lost their parents too.
            </p>
            <p>
              A scammer playing for the sympathy vote with no family or family close by is the perfect cover for not wanting to be traced. You won't ask questions about the location of their deceased relatives will you?! If they claimed to have family you might ask too many questions and search them on line to see if they exist. A scammer doesn't want to leave a trail that will help you to locate them once they have succeeded in extorting money from you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course their are some genuine people who really are widowed with no children or family nearby but such people would happily share with you, their photos of family who actually look like them and you can soon see that they are real people with a family past or present. Scammers using fake photos couldn't possibly have photos of themselves with family could they?!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Scammers often ask a lot of questions to assess your wealth</h4>
            <p>
              Scammers are not interested in you, they are interested in your money. It isn't long before they commence to asking you about your home, do you own it, are you in a well paid career or of independent financial means, do you go on holiday frequently (if you can afford expensive holidays they will assume you have the wealth to afford them). They will ask you if you drive, what sort of car you own and of course they will assume you are wealthy if you drive an expensive car.
            </p>
            <p>
              They will ask if you live alone or have dependent family, if your family live close by and how old they are. They find it easy to target you if you appear to be a wealthy person, living alone in a nice home, with no local family. They would not want to run the risk of targeting someone who had family close by who might discover that you are being scammed for money and persuade you to report the scammer to the police. It is best not to appear to be a person of means on a dating profile, it is better to attract a partner who will love you for who you are and not what you might possess in a monetary or material sense, and genuine people will show interest in you, regardless of your financial or material worth.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Scammers who disappear at weekends and some evenings</h4>
            <p>
              As with members of dating sites who are married and looking to have an extramarital affair only, many scammers disappear at weekends and sometimes in the evening, citing the demands of their career - military usually and after that engineering in overseas locations where they have to work late or at weekends.It is always possible that scammers are married people and so they will be expected to be with marital partners on some evenings and at weekends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another give-away is that scammers will be on line on dating sites during the daytime, when they should be at work in these well paid demanding careers they claim to have! Question this and the usual response is that they are of a senior rank and can designate work to others and enjoy the freedom to get on during the day in between their designating work to colleagues. How convenient! Please take time to consider what is logical here!
            </p>

          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Why would they want to date someone from another country?</h4>
            <p>
              In a logical world, why would someone want to date you if you were located thousands of miles away?
            </p>
            <p>
              This stunning looking person who has fallen in love with you, joined the dating site to find a date living an impractical distance from you, this is often the case with dating site scammers and it is a massive Red flag waving in your face.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask a scammer why they are not looking for someone more local and they will tell you that there is no one as beautiful as you to be found anywhere local to themselves. So the flattery card is pulled out again. You can bet that they will reply with something to charm you into a false sense of security, don't be fooled!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">They want to rapidly chat with you off the dating site</h4>
            <p>
              Scammers know that chatting on a dating site means that the site owners/moderators can also read what they write, so they make a point in saying that they are not into long drawn out messaging on the site and prefer to have a more private place to chat such as their favorite "Google Hangouts", here they can get to work with scamming you out of your money with little risk of being discovered. Policing chat messengers is a much harder task than dating site moderation. Our advice is, do not give out your email address, phone number and do not agree to chatting on a messenger independent to the dating site until you are 100% sure that your love interest is genuine, and even then be cautious. Look to see if your dating site interests have a digital footprint, do a reverse image search on their photos to see if they come up on other websites, like social media. If they don't then the chances are you are in the hands of a scammer. You might like to see if your dating site interest is listed as a scammer on this useful website: <a href="http://pigbusters.org/" class="color-text text_bold hover">Pig Busters</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is better to be safe than sorry.

          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Something always seems to come up when you want to meet them</h4>
            <p>
              Most people will want to arrange to meet with their new love interest off a dating site, but the scammer has no intention of meeting you, they are not the person they claim to be and they look nothing like their profile photo. So it is all too convenient that something will always come up to prevent them meeting you on the date supposedly arranged. This will deflate you and risk them losing their financial target - you, so the flattery is used again in comments saying "Oh I so wanted to meet you, I am so in love with you and I am devastated that what has come up prevents this, but we will meet soon, I promise you that, please lets keep getting to know one another". Who could resist such charm? Hopefully you if you are in the hands of a dating scammer!

          <div class="col-xl-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="subheader">Illiteracy and location confusion</h4>
            <p>
              Our research shows that scammers often write in broken English or the language of your country, being overseas and of a difference spoken homeland language is often cited as an excuse when you challenge this with a scammer
            </p>
            <p>
              The further give-away is that they will appear to be illiterate, their phraseology and use of your countries language will be broken and not read right. This is because most scammers are from impoverished countries notorious for criminality and on line scamming. There is a high incidence however of scammers stating on their fake profiles that they live in your country - this is to make you think that you are in dialogue with a local person or one at least in the same country, but then when you try to discuss a meet up, they will quickly tell you that whilst they have a home in your country, they are actually working away overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would be harder to track a scammer if they were native in a country which does not speak English. Bear this in mind when you are in dialogue with dating site members.
