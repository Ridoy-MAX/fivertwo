            <h4 class="subheader">What is meant by psycho-dynamics</h4>
            <p>
              The path of true love is not always a smooth one as many people know from the challenges they experience
              in their love relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              The psycho-dynamics of love relationships is about understanding and analyzing the complexity of the way
              in which two people relate to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often it's about the psychology of perception, which determines the differences of view point and opinion
              and how we interpret the signals and comprehend the natural differences between the way you might see
              things compared to the way your love partner sees things.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of you may need more space and 'me time' than the other, requests for 'more space' or a temporary
              break from each other can often be misinterpreted as the dreaded precursor to a complete break or lead to
              the assumption that there is 'someone else' around and you are being sidelined or dumped. Insecurities
              soon creep in and inevitably lead to discord, altercations and even heated rows; when the reality could
              have been that your partner just needed some temporary space to consider how they might want to progress
              the relationship and at what speed, particularly in new relationships -post the initial romantic
              'honeymoon period' which comes with the beginning of most new relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the initial 'honeymoon period' many couples find themselves engaging in avid texting, sexting, voice
              and video calling on various chat app s, eager to meet and socialize together, wine and dine, the hearts
              and flowers routine is wonderful but sadly it can be as exhausting as it can a pleasure, and for one of
              other partner it can soon feel like its all a bit too full on and that things are moving a tad to fast, so
              they find the need to slam on the brakes and request a bit of space to try to balance off their new-found
              love interest with their former lifestyle, which involved seeing more of their own friends, pursuing
              hobbies, working late, spending time with family and just about everything else. Often a new love interest
              sidelines the former lifestyle interests and the imbalance can cause conflict with the retention of ones
              own individuality and lifestyle. So a bit of space is about re-grouping and balancing and often nothing
              more - but it is all too easy for the more insecure of us, to misinterpret this as a brush off, being
              replaced, being abused, used, demoted etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sadly insecurities in such situations can often lead to significant damage being done to the former lovely
              rapport you once had when the feelings of being sidelined or replaced amidst a misinterpretation of the
              situation, occurs, it is often the case that the insecure will bombard their partner with endless messages
              and texts, demanding clarification as to what is going on, why the need for space, is there someone else
              around, is there a future for you with your loved one. Bombarding someone with endless messages after they
              have asked for some space just to re-group constitutes harassment, it can even lead to stalking activities
              and this is when any hope of a future with a loved one soon evaporates and can lead to the recipient
              feeling forced to block any incoming messages or phone calls - this can often be a point of no return and
              this in turn is determined by how forgiving the recipient is. We are all individuals and as a result, we
              will all react differently to that of others.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact that we all react differently to challenges in love relationships, is what determines their
              psycho-dynamics and how things are viewed, handled, managed and resolved. What suits the Goose doesn't
              always suit the gander! It would be foolish to expect your partner to take on your viewpoint and needs all
              the time and vice verse! So its about give and take, making allowances for the differences in need and
              viewpoint. Compromising where possible and in as fair and amicable way as is possible. If you want to stay
              together and you are struggling with the psycho-dynamics of your love relationship then please call us and
              let us help to prevent a break up.

            <h4 class="subheader">The importance of trust</h4>
            <p>
              Often our insecurities step from past hurt, past failed relationships in what ever form they may have
              taken, being cheated on in the past, deceived and lied to, can often for the basis for mistrust. This in
              turn can lead to the wrong conclusions being reached when for instance your love partner requests some
              space from you or some 'me time', a temporary break. If you are unable to trust your love partner 100%
              then you really don't have a relationship worthwhile pursuing. The best thing would then to be counseling
              to resolve your feelings of insecurities in order to save a break up with your loved one or to address
              what it is about their behaviour perhaps, which leads you to have no trust in them, and failing that you
              are faced with simply letting go and moving on to someone new, and someone who you can trust 100% and who
              will trust you 100%, true soul mate relationships are ones where there is 100% trust from both sides. Are
              you struggling with a 'trust' problem? If so then we are here to help you, and we will! All is not lost if
              you get the right help as soon as possible.

            <h4 class="subheader">Making comparisons & rebound relationships</h4>
            <p>
              We have all experienced that 'puppy love' from our teenage years, that 'first love' experience which
              always makes a massive impact on us. But as with all past love experiences - every love relationship
              differs, because we are all individuals and so it is often the case that people make the grave mistake of
              comparing a present partner to a past one and more often than not one which had the greatest impact on us,
              be it that first love partner or one since.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people try to get over a broken relationship by quickly moving onto a new one, they want to rebuild
              their damaged self-esteem which stems from perhaps being rejected or dumped by the last partner. Rebound
              relationships, however, are often doomed to ultimate failure, because you will not have given yourself
              time to mend and regain your emotional balance.

            <p>
              Once you indulge in the comparison routine with your rebound partner, it isn't long before you commence to
              causing damage to both the rebound relationship and your rebound partner who then becomes just your bridge
              over troubled waters on the way to someone else. No one likes to be used and abused like that, such is the
              'domino' effect of such activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is vital to give yourself some time between one relationship ending and you're beginning a new one.
              Emotional healing time is an investment in the hope of a future successful and lasting relationship.

            <h4 class="subheader">The tendency to 'over-demanding'</h4>
            <p>
              The wonderful feelings of a new-found love interest often see us getting a tad carried away in the
              whirlwind effect of that lovely romance. Of course, we would love it to continue on in the same avid
              fashion where you 'can't get enough of one another', texting and messaging is full on, you are love struck
              and love sick and yes, love is a sickness! An addiction! But it is natural for this lovely period of
              new-found romance to progress on into a more leveled and balanced one as we start to settle into our new
              relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              This natural cooling can unearth the insecurities of many and the result is that they slip into
              'over-demanding' mode, much always wanting more and more. When this happens damage begins and especially
              when your partner is feeling rather stifled and besieged as indeed they soon will. This is the point where
              you need to contact us to get the help you need to prevent losing your new-found love partner. We can help
              you to achieve balance and preserve your relationship which will help you maintain it. Allowing yourself
              to indulge in 'over-demanding' will inevitably lead to the break up of your relationship nine times out of
              ten.

            <h4 class="subheader">3rd parties and love cheats</h4>
            <p>
              3rd parties and love cheats and 3rd party interference can often cost us the love of our lives, just as
              insecurities, a jealous nature, over-possessiveness, mistrust, dishonesty, telling lies, harassment,
              stalking and all manner of other negative dynamics in our relationships with one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you suspect that your love partner is cheating on you, it is wise to be 100% certain that your
              suspicions are right before accusing your partner of infidelity. No one likes being accused of this when
              it is not the case.

              suspicions are right before accusing your partner of infidelity. No one likes being accused of this when
              it is not the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have had clients telling us that they have resorted to putting Key gens (spy-ware and hacking software)
              onto their loved one's mobile phone, or GPS trackers on their partners car, because they have suspected
              them of cheating. This is a serious invasion of privacy and a form of stalking which is illegal.
              Insecurities from past hurt often fuel the fire in such instances but they do not justify such actions.
              There is a right and wrong way to handle suspicions of infidelity and we can help with this too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other 3rd parties like former wives/husbands to who our partner or ourselves may have children, form 3rd
              party issues, especially when fed by insecurities or trust issues. Likewise, is so by interfering family
              members who want to control you and even determine who you have love relationships with, this can be on
              account of cultural issues or simply over-bearing nature in perhaps parents who are over-protective or
              over-controlling. Does this resonate with your situation? If so then please do call us and let us help you
              deal with this before you lose the love of your life.

            <h4 class="subheader">Communication & the psychology of perception</h4>
            <p>
              Good communication in all relationships, including love relationships, is vital to their endurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              When communication breaks down, for whatever reason, this can be the start of either an impasse situation
              where one or other party perhaps due to an obstinate nature, refuses to communicate at all, or if they do,
              it is on their terms only.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disagreements and rows, are often due to one misunderstanding the other, misinterpreting the signals or
              what is communicated verbally, be it person to person in speech or via text or some other form of
              electronic communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              One person's perception of a situation may differ from that of another, this can lead to
              misinterpretation. It's often about the 'psychology of perception'.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people suspect that if their partner asks for some space or a break, that it must be that they are
              having an affair with a 3rd party, when this might not be the case. Insecurities stemming from being
              cheated on in the past, will consequently fuel such suspicion but that doesn't mean that a wrong
              conclusion is justifiable. It isn't nice to be accused of infidelity when you are loyal and trustworthy by
              nature and disinclined to cheat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people are not very good at communication, perhaps they are of a more 'reserved' nature and like periods of time alone in their own space, or they are people who find full on relationships too stifling. Sadly such people can find themselves being accused of secrecy, cheating and are tarred with the same brush as it were, as a person who is inclined to cheat.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is vital that communication is worked on, nurtured, maintained and balanced, so that a love relationship can endure long term.
            </p>
            <p>
